# CSV-Test-File-Creation-Tool
For my school applications I will need to test my applications with a test file. The point of this application is to create a test file (CSV file) that will be scalable to any program.
There will be various options to change how the CSV will be including:
	What each column's type of data will be
	How many columns there would be in total
	Option to name the first column
